# HV Billing — Hydrokrat Ventures

Windows desktop billing software for Hydrokrat Ventures: create Quotations, Proforma Invoices, and Tax Invoices, manage customers and products, and export/print documents in the company's letterhead theme.

## Running in development

```
npm install
npm start
```

Data is stored locally in a SQLite database under the app's user data folder (not inside this project folder), so it persists across restarts and app updates.

## Building the Windows installer

```
npm run dist
```

This produces an NSIS installer under `dist/`. Before building, replace `assets/icon.ico` with a real icon (256x256 recommended) — a placeholder is not included.

## Features

- **Dashboard** — quick-create buttons for each document type, recent documents.
- **Documents** — Quotation / Proforma Invoice / Tax Invoice, each with independent auto-numbering (`QT-HV-2026-001`, `PI-HV-2026-001`, `TI-HV-2026-001`), search/filter, duplicate-as-another-type, print, and Save as PDF.
- **Customers & Products** — reusable master lists, add/edit/delete, searchable, used when building a document.
- **Settings** — company details, bank details, and default Terms & Conditions per document type (pre-filled with Hydrokrat Ventures' details).
- **GST logic** — automatically splits into CGST+SGST when the customer's state matches the company's state (Tamil Nadu), otherwise applies IGST.
